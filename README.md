# JavaSocket
A simple example of java socket programming. The reason behind this project is to use it as a clipboard between my laptop and phone. You must be wondering how could I compile JavaSE codes in android phones. Ta..da.. AIDE makes it easy for me. Just search aide in playsore if you want to have it.
